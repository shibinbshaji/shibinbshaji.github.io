        <h3>A Long Overdue Write-up: How I got into the Oppo Hall of Fame
        </h3>
        
        </div>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t do Bug Bounty programs much, so this section of the website will be as deserted as the roads when we all were in quarantine. If I happen to stumble upon some interesting bug I sit and try to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Yes, I stumbled upon this bug. Walking down the memory lane, last year, I caught hold of a Redmi device owned by my friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-t-s/">Muhammad T S</a>, and it was locked. Out of curiosity I turned on the screen and saw an ad (Ads or articles on Lockscreens deserve the same place in peoples minds as pop-up ads). I clicked on all the possible links and buttons and next thing I knew, I was on the main page of Google. Thereon, I was able to browse the internet like my own device. No restrictions. And I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about the data usage.</p>
<p>I was too lazy to report that bug as it required me to invest a good amount of time from my busy final year days at college. I thought, &ldquo;Maybe later&rdquo;. After around two months, I found out that it was reported by someone else :( . My laziness cost me a Hall of Fame in Xiaomi. :((((((</p>
<p>Couple of days later my friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/d3vilsnar3/">Govind P</a>, got a new Oppo phone. I checked out the phone and then locked the device. I turned on the screen and there it was, the disgusting Lockscreen ads with the same sh***y UI.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/excited-cat.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>I thought about the steps to reproduce what I did on Redmi. I was presented with a screen as shown.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/one.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There was a &ldquo;More&rdquo; button which allowed me to read the article. I clicked on that. Clicking that opened up an article and i scrolled down to see if it showed an ad. Yes, it did and it was Google Ads.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/two.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you ever noticed Google ads, they have a tiny close button (x) at the top right along with an info button (i). This is one of the moments where I want to say &ldquo;I have a meme for that.!!&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/two1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I clicked on that (i) and it showed me this:</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/three.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>It will minimize the article and show a menu like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/four.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I clicked on the Hamburger menu icon on the top left and another menu opened up.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/five.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Yeah you guessed it. I clicked the on the grid menu icon and guess what showed up! The Google apps. Yey!!!!!</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/six.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I could take any apps from that. But if I took Google, it took me directly to Google Search. I could search anything and redirect to any websites.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/seven1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I could even play YouTube videos.</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/seven2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>As simple as that. No tool was employed to find out this vulnerability. It was an error in the implementation of the rarely used feature (Lockscreen ads / articles). The OS did not check for any authentication of the actions performed while in the Lockscreen. It might have assumed that it is safe because it&rsquo;s the Lockscreen. (So is it a Lockscreen Bypass??? IDK, maybe&hellip;)</p>
<p>But wait, the article is not over!! The menu which showed Google apps was scrollable and it revealed Gmail when I scrolled down. So I clicked on that. It showed the login page of Google. Dead end? No! Because when I clicked the &lsquo;Username&rsquo; field, Google&rsquo;s Autofill showed up!!!!</p>
<p><img src="/bug-bounty/oppo-bugbounty-writeup/eight.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Turns out, it was connected to the built in browser of the device and any passwords that were saved on that browser can Autofill in this Login page. Sadly, I could not further exploit this vulnerability as the Post Login page will be shown only after unlocking the device.</p>
<p>I decided to be less lazy and report the issue ASAP.</p>
<p><em><strong>April 2019</strong></em> - Reported the bug.</p>
<p><em><strong>May 2019</strong></em> - Issue was confirmed and was rewarded 10,000 INR.</p>
<p>The bounty took a long time to get credited, though!.</p>
<p>Hope you liked this article. :)</p>
